- [ ] chore: Remove enter-to-accept suggestions.
      **Reasoning:** Accidental accepts are really annoying to deal with.
- [ ] Notifications to the left
      **See:** https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify/issues/124
- [ ] Declarative configuration management with _Neoconf_. Neoconf, however, does not support general
      configuration besides LSP at the moment so I'll probably have to make a plugin that extends it.
      Someone did take a shot at it earlier in 2023, but it doesn't cover much ground:
      _Alternatively_, I could contribute back to neoconf if `folke` is receptive of the idea.
      **Note:** I really, really want this for `colorscheme`, `wrap` etc :plead:

- [ ] Tailored markdown editing
      - **Reasoning:** Markdown with tailored keymaps makes for a good experience,
            incidentally it also falls in the realm of expectations from using
            virtually any markdown editor.
      - **Options:** 
            - https://github.com/antonk52/markdowny.nvim/blob/main/lua/markdowny.lua
- [ ] Improve pair-handling. Currently the pair plugin (`mini-pair`?) does not
      detect existing unmatches pairs on the line and also fails to detect
      and act upon deletion of pair on other lines/same line making it difficult
      to work with pairs after deleting one of the parts. Consider:
      - Enter \`. Paired \` appears.
      - Delete second \`. First one remains.
      - Insert \`. First \` is ignored, 2 \` are inserted again.
      PAIN!
- [ ] Improved `null-ls` setup that ships with spell checks and code-actions.
      For spell-checking consider `cspell` among other more involved options like LanguageTool
      **Reference:** https://nullvoxpopuli.com/2023-03-13-null-ls/
- [ ] Disable, by default, mini-indentscope for large files. Or at least the markers. They're slow..
- [ ] feat: Codeium as a copilot alternative.
      **Options:**

      with a `:tag:` (Telescope).
- [ ] feat: improved Harpoon mappings for more utility

- [ ] feat: consider using Neogit or fugitive or a more nvim-centric
      git workflow.
- [ ] feat: Smart colorcolumn
      [smartcolumn.nvim](https://github.com/m4xshen/smartcolumn.nvim).
