_A tailored prose-writing and programming environment based on @folke's [LazyVim](https://github.com/lazyvim/lazyvim)_

## Requirements

- Neovim Nightly.
- Terminal emulator with support for the [Kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).
- `sqlite` and `lib-sqlite`. See [instructions](https://github.com/kkharji/sqlite.lua#-installation).

## Features

- [x] Debug Go, Rust, JS and others out of the box.
- [x] Integrated tests for popular languages/frameworks (powered by Neotest)
- [x] Automatic session management (including reloads!) with flag (`+NoSession`) to disable it.
- [x] Floating, persistent terminal
- [x] Better _marks_ with [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon).
